### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a current student at BloomTech, but I've been in athletics and coaching my whole life.

I enjoy using data to validate methods and to see results from methods being used.
Data gives you real life results that you can't ignore during evaluations. 
The work of Data Science isn't always fun for me, but getting the results after succesfully testing a model makes all the work seem worth it!

I really like building things using SQL and API models, and hope to use it more in future projects.

I am a strong supporter for makeawish and always volunteer whenever possible.
